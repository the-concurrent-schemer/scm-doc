*The primary call for help is to review, implement _(in Erlang)_, and
test the Scheme R7RS standard libraries.* A secondary call for help is
to identify, to fix, and to resolve key issues posted to CSCM's issue
tracker.  A little bit of Scheme and/or Erlang programming experience
is helpful but not absolutely necessary.

CAUTION: _Please stay tuned for CSCM updates.  The specification,
documentation, and software are under construction._

== Miscellaneous TODO Items

- pending R7RS draft 10 changes
  * Remove extra exponent markers from formal syntax

== Getting Started

An incomplete list of steps for "Getting Started".

*Mandatory*

1. read the Scheme
  http://trac.sacrideo.us/wg/raw-attachment/wiki/WikiStart/overview.pdf[overview]
  paper

2. download and build
+
[source,shell]
------
git clone git://github.com/the-concurrent-schemer/scm.git
cd scm
make deps
make

------
+
TIP: Check the Software Requirements listed below before attempting to
download and build!

3. run "hello world" example
+
[source,scheme]
------
(define hello-world
  (lambda ()
    (display "Hello World!")))
------
+

Since CSCM is under construction, this example must be run manually
for the time being.  Let's use the Erlang shell for illustrative
purposes.

   a. Start the Erlang shell.
+
[source,shell]
------
erl -pa ./deps/parse-tools/ebin -pa ebin
------

   b. Save the "hello word" program as an Erlang string.
+
[source,erlang]
------
Str = "(define hello-world (lambda () (display \"Hello World!\")))".
------
+

   c. Create an empty Scheme environment.
+
[source,erlang]
------
Env = scmi_env:the_empty().
------
+

   d. Create and register a native Erlang function as a simple
      implementation for the Scheme display library procedure. The
      Erlang function writes the given arguments to stdout as Erlang
      terms and simply returns a Scheme #false to the caller.
+
[source,erlang]
------
False = {boolean,undefined,false}.
Proc = {nipv, 0, fun(Args) -> io:format("~p~n", [Args]), False end}.
scmi_env:define_variable('display', Proc, Env).
------
+

   e. Parse and evaluate the "hello world" program.
+
[source,erlang]
------
{ok, Exp} = scmd_parse:string(Str).
scmi_eval:eval(Exp, Env).
------
+

   f. Call the Scheme "hello-world" procedure and show the Scheme
      return value in the Erlang shell.
+
[source,erlang]
------
R = scmi_eval:eval(['hello-world'], Env).
R.
------

*Optional (but helpful)*

1. read the final Scheme R7RS
   http://trac.sacrideo.us/wg/raw-attachment/wiki/WikiStart/r7rs.pdf[small
   report] specification and
   http://trac.sacrideo.us/wg/wiki/R7RSSmallErrata[errata]

2. review and understand
   a. the layout of the scm git
      https://github.com/the-concurrent-schemer/scm/tree/dev[repository]
+
TIP: Filename prefixes have meaning => +scmd_+ is "datum", +scmi_+ is
"interpreter", +scmc_+ is "compiler", +scml_+ is "library", and +xfm_+
is "Erlang parse transform".

   b. the CSCM datum model
       ** https://github.com/the-concurrent-schemer/scm/blob/dev/src/scmd_types_impl.erl[implementation]
          of Scheme datums by Erlang terms
       ** Scheme
          https://github.com/the-concurrent-schemer/scm/blob/dev/src/scml_base_equality.erl#L23[equivalence
          predicates] base library and a subset of Scheme
          https://github.com/the-concurrent-schemer/scm/blob/dev/src/scml_base_number.erl#L217[numbers]
          base library
       ** Erlang
          https://github.com/the-concurrent-schemer/scm/blob/dev/src/scmd_types.erl[types]
          used for documentation and static type analysis
+
TIP: If helpful, review Erlang's
http://www.erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/typespec.html[documentation]
about types and function specifications.

   c. Scheme
      https://github.com/the-concurrent-schemer/scm/blob/dev/src/scmd_scan.xrl[datum]
      and number
      (https://github.com/the-concurrent-schemer/scm/blob/dev/src/scmd_scan_num2.xrl[base
      2],
      https://github.com/the-concurrent-schemer/scm/blob/dev/src/scmd_scan_num8.xrl[base
      8],
      https://github.com/the-concurrent-schemer/scm/blob/dev/src/scmd_scan_num10.xrl[base
      10], and
      https://github.com/the-concurrent-schemer/scm/blob/dev/src/scmd_scan_num16.xrl[base
      16]) tokenizers

   d. Scheme
      https://github.com/the-concurrent-schemer/scm/blob/dev/src/scmd_parse.yrl[datum]
      and
      https://github.com/the-concurrent-schemer/scm/blob/dev/src/scmd_parse_numR.yrl[number]
      parsers

   e. Scheme environment resource
      https://github.com/the-concurrent-schemer/scm/blob/dev/src/scmi_env.erl[wrapper]
      and
      https://github.com/the-concurrent-schemer/scm/blob/dev/c_src/scmi_env.cc[NIF]
+
TIP: If helpful, review Erlang's
http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/erl_nif.html[documentation] about API
functions for an Erlang NIF library.

   f. Scheme interpreter
      https://github.com/the-concurrent-schemer/scm/blob/dev/src/scmi_eval.erl[evaluator]
      and
      https://github.com/the-concurrent-schemer/scm/blob/dev/src/scmi_analyze.erl[syntactic
      analyzer]

   g. Scheme
      https://github.com/the-concurrent-schemer/scm/blob/dev/src/scmi_analyze_primitive.erl[primitive]
      expressions

   h. Scheme
      https://github.com/the-concurrent-schemer/scm/blob/dev/src/scmi_analyze_derived.erl[derived]
      expressions

   i. Scheme
      https://github.com/the-concurrent-schemer/scm/blob/dev/src/scmi_analyze_macro.erl[macro]
      expressions

   j. Scheme
      https://github.com/the-concurrent-schemer/scm/blob/dev/src/scml_base_control.erl#L124[control
      features] base library

   k. Scheme
      https://github.com/the-concurrent-schemer/scm/blob/dev/src/scml_base_exception.erl#L71[exceptions]
      base library

   l. ...

3. run xref
+
[source,shell]
------
make xref

------

4. generate edocs
+
[source,shell]
------
make doc

------

NOTE: Steps describing how to setup and to run Erlang's dialyzer will
be added later.

== Submissions

This process is a +DRAFT+.

Please review and follow these guidelines for contribution
submissions.

- Try to keep all submissions simple, clear, and concise
  * remove all unused or unnecessary code
  * remove unnecessary whitespace
  * fix all compiler warnings, run xref, and run dialyzer on each
    submission
  * use +@TODO+ comment markers when helpful

- Create a topic branch off the 'dev' branch for each pull request

- Create a single commit for each pull request and try to focus each
  commit on a single topic or a set of related topics => _help make it
  easier for others to review and to test_

- Update the Edoc +@author+ tag of each module where you are
  considered a primary author

- Ensure the the copyright and license shown below is included in all
  submissions

- As much as "practically" possible, follow the CSCM roadmap and
  mailto:nortonATalum.mit.edu?subject=Contributing%20to%20The%20Concurrent%20Schemer[notify
  Joe N.] in advance of your plans to minimize the duplication efforts

- Most importantly there is no rush and have fun!

NOTE: For the near term, only documentation and code submissions will
be accepted in an attempt to keep the layout and contents of the scm
repository simple, clear and concise.  Testing such as unit,
regression, compatibility, and performance testing will be addressed
later.

== Resources

*Emacs*

An editor (just like a programming language) is a creature of choice.
An editor should also be a creature of comfort.  If Emacs happens to
be your favorite creature for editing, I highly recommend the
following packages:

  * https://github.com/norton/emacs-starter-kit/blob/norton/norton/init.el#L43[whitespace]
  * https://github.com/norton/emacs-starter-kit/blob/norton/norton/init.el#L75[indent]
  * erlang with
    https://github.com/norton/emacs-starter-kit/blob/norton/norton/erlang.el#L31[flymake]
    (and rebar support)

These packages are very helpful (and comforting) for Erlang
development.
