== Overview

"The Concurrent Schemer" (CSCM) is an implementation of the Scheme
programming language built on top of the Erlang Virtual Machine.  CSCM
combines the sequential programming model of Scheme with the
concurrent, distributed, and fault-tolerant programming model of
Erlang.  The default language is Scheme R7RS.  The default virtual
machine is Erlang/OTP R16B or higher.

Scheme is a statically scoped and properly tail recursive dialect of
the Lisp programming language invented by Guy Lewis Steele Jr. and
Gerald Jay Sussman at MIT.  It was designed to have exceptionally
clear and simple semantics and few different ways to form expressions.
A wide variety of programming paradigms, including imperative,
functional, and object-oriented styles, find convenient expression in
Scheme.

Erlang is a programming language used to build massively scalable,
soft, real-time systems with requirements on high availability.
Erlang's runtime system has built-in support for concurrency,
distribution and fault tolerance.  It is designed at the Ericsson
Computer Science Laborary and is maintained as an open-source project
and community.

CAUTION: _This documentation is under construction.  Please stay tuned
for more information later._

== Features

- The following standard features are supported or planned to be
  supported:

  * +r7rs+
  * +exact-closed+
  * +exact-complex+
  * +ieee-float+
  * +full-unicode+
  * +ratios+
  * +posix+ when the Erlang +os:type/0+ function returns +unix+ for
    +Osfamily+.
  * +windows+ when the Erlang +os:type/0+ function returns +win32+ for
    +Osfamily+.
  * +<Osfamily>+ as returned by Erlang os:type/0 function
  * +<Osname>+ as returned by Erlang os:type/0 function
  * +<Otprel>+ as returned by Erlang erlang:system_info/1 function for
    +'otp_release'+
  * +<Sysarch>+ as returned by Erlang erlang:system_info/1 function
    for +'system_architecture'+
  * Subparts of +<Sysarch>+ split by the "-" character token
  * +<Wordsize>+ as returned by Erlang erlang:system_info/1 function
    for +{'wordsize', 'external'}+ multiplied by 8
  * +big-endian+
  * +scm+
  * +scm-X.Y.Z+ where X is the major, Y is the minor, and Z is the
    patch release version of scm

== Roadmap

- Programming
  * Sequential
  * Concurrent
  * Open Telecom Platform (OTP)
- Libraries, Tools, and Integration
- Applications
- Deployments
- Education and Training

== Limitations

- The +#!fold-case+ and +#!no-fold-case+ directives are treated as
  comments and have no effect on identifiers and character names read
  from the same port.

- Inexact constants have double precision regardless of the specified
  exponent marker.

- The following symbols are reserved and not allowed as a variable in
  +set!+ and +define+ procedure calls:

  * +quote+
  * +label+
  * +labelref+
  * +set!+
  * +define+
  * +if+
  * +lambda+
  * +include+
  * +include-ci+
  * +cond+
  * +case+
  * +and+
  * +or+
  * +when+
  * +unless+
  * +cond-expand+
  * +let+
  * +let*+
  * +letrec+
  * +letrec*+
  * +begin+
  * +do+
  * +make-parameter+
  * +parameterize+
  * +guard+
  * +quasiquotation+
  * +unquote+
  * +unquote-splicing+

- The following +(scheme base)+ library exports are not supported:
  * +set-car!+
  * +set-cdr!+
  * +list-set!+

// == Quickstart
//
// To download and build the scm application in one shot, please follow
// this recipe:
//
// ------
// $ mkdir working-directory-name
// $ cd working-directory-name
// $ git clone https://github.com/the-concurrent-schemer/scm.git scm
// $ cd scm
// $ make deps clean compile
// ------
//
// - start REPL
// - eval an expression
// - compile a source file or files
// - ...
