== Overview

"The Concurrent Schemer" (CSCM) is an implementation of the Scheme
programming language built on top of the Erlang Virtual Machine.  CSCM
combines the sequential programming model of Scheme with the
concurrent, distributed, and fault-tolerant programming model of
Erlang.  Simply put, the goals of CSCM are concurrent Scheme,
distributed Scheme, and fault-tolerant Scheme.

Scheme is a statically scoped and properly tail recursive dialect of
the Lisp programming language invented by Guy Lewis Steele Jr. and
Gerald Jay Sussman at MIT.  Scheme was designed to have exceptionally
clear and simple semantics and few different ways to form expressions.
A wide variety of programming paradigms, including imperative,
functional, and object-oriented styles, find convenient expression in
Scheme.

Erlang is a programming language used to build massively scalable,
soft, real-time systems with requirements on high availability.
Erlang's runtime system has built-in support for concurrency,
distribution and fault tolerance.  Erlang is designed at the Ericsson
Computer Science Laborary and is maintained as an open-source project
and community.

The default language is Scheme R7RS.  The default virtual machine is
Erlang/OTP R16B or higher.

CAUTION: _Please stay tuned for CSCM updates.  The specification,
documentation, and software are under construction._

== Enhancements

- The following enhancements beyond the <<R7RS>> specification are
  supported:

  * +include+ _primitive expression_.  A filename may start with a
    path component '$VAR', for some string VAR.  If so, the value of
    the environment variable VAR as returned by
    '(get-environment-variable VAR)' is subsititued for '$VAR'.  If
    +get-environment-variable+ returns false, '$VAR' is left as is.
    If the filename is absolute (possibly after variable
    substitution), the include file with that name is included.
    Otherwise, the specified file is searched for in the current
    working directory, in the same directory as the current including
    file, and in the directories given by the 'include' option, in
    that order.  The 'include' option is available for the scm shell
    and scm compiler.
  * +include-lib+ _primitive expression_.  +include-lib+ is similar to
    +include+ but should not point out an absolute file. Instead, the
    first path component is assumed to be the name of an _Erlang_
    application.  If the filename is absolute (possibly after variable
    substitution), an error is raised.  Otherwise, the file is
    searched using the Erlang code:lib_dir/1 function.
  * +letrec-values+ _derived expression binding construct_

== Limitations

- The following symbols are reserved and not allowed as the variable
  in +set!+, +define+, +define-values+, +define-syntax+,
  +define-record-type+, and +define-library+ procedure calls. The
  +delay+, +delay-force+, +force+, +promise?+, and +make-promise+
  symbols of _section 4.2.5_ are implemented as +(scheme lazy)+
  library exports and thus are not reserved symbols.  The
  +case-lambda+ symbol of _section 4.2.9_ is implemented as a +(scheme
  case-lambda)+ library export and thus is not a reserved symbol.

  * +quote+ _section 4.1.2_
  * +lambda+ _section 4.1.4_
  * +if+ _section 4.1.5_
  * +set!+ _section 4.1.6_
  * +include+ _section 4.1.7_
  * +include-ci+ _section 4.1.7_
  * +include-lib+ _enhancement_
  * +include-lib-ci+ _unsupported enhancement_
  * +cond+ _section 4.2.1_
  * +case+ _section 4.2.1_
  * +and+ _section 4.2.1_
  * +or+ _section 4.2.1_
  * +when+ _section 4.2.1_
  * +unless+ _section 4.2.1_
  * +cond-expand+ _section 4.2.1_
  * +let+ _section 4.2.2_
  * +let*+ _section 4.2.2_
  * +letrec+ _section 4.2.2_
  * +letrec*+ _section 4.2.2_
  * +let-values+ _section 4.2.2_
  * +let*-values+ _section 4.2.2_
  * +letrec-values+ _enhancement_
  * +begin+ _section 4.2.3_
  * +do+ _section 4.2.4_
  * +make-parameter+ _section 4.2.6_
  * +parameterize+ _section 4.2.6_
  * +guard+ _section 4.2.7_
  * +quasiquote+ _section 4.2.8_
  * +unquote+ _section 4.2.8_
  * +unquote-splicing+ _section 4.2.8_
  * +let-syntax+ _section 4.3.1_
  * +letrec-syntax+ _section 4.3.1_
  * +syntax-rules+ _section 4.3.2_
  * +syntax-error+ _section 4.3.2_
  * +import+ _section 5.2_
  * +define+ _section 5.3.1 and 5.3.2_
  * +define-values+ _section 5.3.3_
  * +define-syntax+ _section 5.4_
  * +define-record-type+ _section 5.5_
  * +define-library+ _section 5.6_

- Unsupported lexical conventions:
  * +datum labels+
  * The +#!fold-case+ and +#!no-fold-case+ directives are treated as
    comments and have no effect on identifiers and character names
    read from the same port.

- Unsupported primitive expressions:
  * +include-ci+
  * +include-lib-ci+ _unsupported enhancement_

- Unsupported +(scheme base)+ library exports:
  * +bytevector-copy!+
  * +bytevector-u8-set!+
  * +list-set!+
  * +read-bytevector!+
  * +set-car!+
  * +set-cdr!+
  * +string-copy!+
  * +string-fill!+
  * +string-set!+
  * +vector-copy!+
  * +vector-fill!+
  * +vector-set!+

- Miscellaneous
  * Inexact constants have double precision regardless of the
    specified exponent marker.
