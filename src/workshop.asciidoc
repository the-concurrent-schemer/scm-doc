// Joe Norton is a technical manager, system architect, developer, and
// Erlang/Scheme enthusiast.  Based out of Tokyo, Japan, he has designed,
// developed, tested, deployed, and supported carrier grade
// Erlang/OTP-based messaging and storage systems.
//
//
// The Concurrent Schemer - Hands-On
//
// "The Concurrent Schemer" (CSCM) is an implementation of the Scheme
// programming language built on top of the Erlang Virtual Machine.  CSCM
// combines the sequential programming model of Scheme with the
// concurrent, distributed, and fault-tolerant programming model of
// Erlang.  The default language is Scheme R7RS.  The default virtual
// machine is Erlang/OTP R16B01 or higher.
//
// The goal of this workshop is to provide a concurrent introduction to
// Scheme and Erlang.  An overview of Scheme will be presented based on
// the latest draft of the "Revised 7 Report on the Algorithmic Language
// Scheme" (R7RS) specification.  An overview of Erlang will be
// simultaneously presented based on the latest CSCM implementation built
// using the Erlang Virtual Machine.
//
// Since CSCM is a work in progress, the workshop materials and
// presentation will be of alpha quality.
//
// Please see http://the-concurrent-schemer.github.io/scm-doc/ for
// further information.
//
//
// About myself, I have 20+ years of professional software experience and
// 10 years of system and software architecture experience.  I have 5+
// years of hands-on Erlang/OTP experience. I have designed, developed,
// tested, deployed, and supported carrier grade Erlang/OTP (starting
// from R11B-5) messaging and storage systems.  I often attend and
// sometimes present at Erlang/Functional programming conferences.  My
// open-source projects and applications can be viewed on GitHub
// (https://github.com/norton).
