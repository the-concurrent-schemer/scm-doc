= Bootstrap documentation-style backend for AsciiDoc

An AsciiDoc backend that renders the AsciiDoc source as HTML5 in the style of the http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap[Twitter Bootstrap docs].

== Installation

To install the bootstrap docs backend, download https://github.com/downloads/mojavelinux/asciidoc-bootstrap-docs-backend/bootstrap-docs.zip[bootstrap-docs.zip] and install it using the asciidoc command (you will need AsciiDoc version 8.6.6 or newer):

 asciidoc --backend install bootstrap-docs.zip

Next, checkout the Twitter Bootstrap repositor in the backend folder:

 cd ~/.asciidoc/backends/bootstrap-docs
 git clone git://github.com/twitter/bootstrap.git

If you enable the link-assets attribute, then you should also checkout (or symlink) the bootstrap clone in the same directory as the rendered file. You also need to create a symlink to asciidoc.js included in this backend.

== Usage

Use the 'bootstrap-docs' backend as you would the built-in backends.

== Example

As you would expect, the rendered output looks shockingly similar to the Twitter Bootstrap documentation.

Compare the original http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/base-css.html[Base CSS] chapter with the http://cloud.github.com/downloads/mojavelinux/asciidoc-bootstrap-docs-backend/example.html[HTML output] from this https://raw.github.com/mojavelinux/asciidoc-bootstrap-docs-backend/master/examples/base-css-book.asciidoc[AsciiDoc source]. Hey Twitter, want to switch to AsciiDoc?
